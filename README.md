# React The Boring Part

Setup for React apps. It's not going to force you to use any specyfic toolset/framework. Be free and make **your** choice. *React The Boring Part* it just a setup which allows you to develop and deploy app without pain. It's not a bare minimum, although I tried to keep things simple.

## Scripts

Start **Express**

```bash
npm start
NODE_ENV=production npm start # force production
```

Start **Express** `&` **WebpackDevServer** (*needed only in development*)

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build (*needed only in production*)

```bash
npm run build
```
